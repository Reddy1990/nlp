TERM DEPOSIT RATE CHANGES There were no term deposit rates changes today , but both Heartland Bank and the Police Credit Union cut savings account rates .  BUSINESS BORROWING TO PAY THE GROCERIES The Government has announced it will write ' viable ' small businesses loans of up to $100,000 , interest-free for the first year , depending on how many employees they have . The borrower will still have to pay the principal back . The scheme seems to be unsecured lending to help businesses pay bills when they have no or suppressed revenues . How such businesses can be ' viable ' in such a state is n't clear . Borrowing to pay operating expenses is n't something any adviser would recommend , apart from covering an in-month cashflow timing issue with an overdraft .

The rentier bond trading crowd are certain to line up lower yields after yesterday 's Treasury tender for the RBNZ LSAP ( QE ) action , come Monday .  The 5.5% 15/04/23s which traded at 0.099% at the RBNZ purchase window on Monday were issued yesterday at 0.1693% and are conveniently quoted this afternoon at : 0.09/0.06 20x100 last traded at 0.06% .  Some are fundamentally screwed in that their business model does n't work anymore , but for each one of those @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a giant cashflow hole from being shut down . There are also quite a few that are still viable but require some sort of logistical pivot to stay alive ( eg switching from a physical store to online store and delivery system ) .  The Aussie equities market is in a serious fall today , currently down -3.8% so far .  Is the reality of Australia 's war like posture towards China finally evident to those least likely to benefit .  It is a most ludicrous and immature illusion for Australia to think it is growing bigger and taller by waging one skirmish after another against China . By placing itself as a chess piece in Washington 's Indo-Pacific Strategy , Australia is still playing its part as America 's " deputy sheriff . " Bilateral relations between China and Australia have hit a record-low over the past three years . For almost 30 years , Australia sustained its economic growth by riding on the coattails of China 's monumental development . China is Australia 's largest destination of exports , largest source of international tourists and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  The Morrison government 's adventurism to fiddle with this mutually beneficial comprehensive strategic partnership is in defiance of rational thought and common sense . It has seriously ravaged trust , confidence and shared interests , which are the bedrocks of the bilateral relationship . Canberra is treading on a hazardous path that has no prospect for a U-turn during the COVID-19 pandemic , and likely for a long time afterward . Link  " I have been able to confirm with a highly reliable source that @NZNationalParty is 29% in the latest UMR poll sent to its corporate clients . This is not a bullshit whispered " private poll " but one they have put their brand to and sent to people who pay a lot of money for it . "  However , UMR warned that the political numbers should be taken with a grain of salt .  " They the poll numbers need to be interpreted extremely carefully . The conventional wisdom is that natural disasters ( and wars ) are usually good for governments but that those effects can wear off quickly . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ govern in the next turn and have to clean up the terrible financial mess the current government are creating . Labour has to and will have another term and crash spectacularly in 3 1/2 years . Quote me then  I imagine the short-term loan market is about to have a bunch of 7-week loan offerings hit the market .....  It 's a great piece of work , but I do hope they 've got failsafes to prevent the industry just gaming the timings of the loan to completely avoid the legislation .  A great example from my late-teens , there was a generation of us drinking cheap nasty spirits , $11 for 1 litre of 22% Vodka , Gin , Whisky in the late 90 's was very economical .  There was a lot of harm going on from these drinks , so they put on an decent sized extra tax on beverages in a range ( 14% - 30% I believe ) and excluded Ports etc to not annoy the oldies . What happened next ? 13.9% for 1 litre , for $7.99 , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you 'll still find Kristov Vodka at 13.9% on the bottom shelf .  " The NZX50 Capital Index is down -0.4% near the end of trade today , and closing in on a zero weekly change . "  Zero weekly change , , I can live with that , it is better than a reversal . We are also a week closer to level 2 and more businesses starting up again , not this level 3 nonsense where everybody 's interpretation differs . Stand behind the line , come forward again , now move back again . The shop manager wanted me to confirm the price quoted elsewhere so I showed him on my phone , I held out my phone for him to see but he insisted I place it on the door table then move back and then he picked up my phone with his dirty hands . Dumb .
